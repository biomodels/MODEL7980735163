**Abstract:**   
We have developed a single-compartment, electrophysiological, hypoglossal
motoneuron (HM) model based primarily on experimental data from neonatal rat
HMs. The model is able to reproduce the fine features of the HM action
potential: the fast afterhyperpolarization, the afterdepolarization, and the
medium-duration afterhyperpolarization (mAHP). The model also reproduces the
repetitive firing properties seen in neonatal HMs and replicates the neuron's
response to pharmacological experiments. The model was used to study the role
of specific ionic currents in HM firing and how variations in the densities of
these currents may account for age-dependent changes in excitability seen in
HMs. By varying the density of a fast inactivating calcium current, the model
alternates between accelerating and adapting firing patterns. Modeling the
age-dependent increase in H current density accounts for the decrease in mAHP
duration observed experimentally, but does not fully account for the decrease
in input resistance. An increase in the density of the voltage-dependent
potassium currents and the H current is required to account for the decrease
in input resistance. These changes also account for the age-dependent decrease
in action potential duration.
